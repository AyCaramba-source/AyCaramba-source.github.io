### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-adam-and-david)

    I thoroughly enjoyed Lab 7 Part 1 because I was always curious about how websites were able to take input from a user and output an answer using
    a formula. In this lab, we used the Fliegel & Van Flandern algorithm to find the difference between two given dates. I found it really cool 
    how we were able to find the exact number of how far each given input was away from each other. I actually thought that this would alot more 
    complicated but was taken aback by how easy it was. 
    
* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-david-and-adam)

    Hands down, I had the most fun doing this lab compared to every other lab throughout the entire year. Lab 8 Part 3 was remarkably beautiful 
    because we were able to code a program that generated animated images on our computers. During this lab, I learned how to store and create animations.
    After finishing the lab, my partner and I had so much fun just playing through all the different animations inside the program. One our favorite ones 
    included the Rocket Ship animation, where a shuttle was animated flying into space with fumes coming out of the rocket. 
    
* [Lab 3]( https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-AyCaramba-source)

    Although compared to the other labs that we've completed throughout the year, which were definitely more complicated, I found Lab 3 Part 3 to be really 
    simple and fun to code. In this lab, we had to code a program which had the two users play against each other to guess a secret number. When I was 
    younger, I used to play small games like this on cool math games against friends. This was a nice lab because it brought back memories and gave me insight
    on the games I played were coded. In this lab, I was introduced to using if statements to code a program, which was used alot in later labs.
